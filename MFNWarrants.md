What MFN does in practice

MFN typically applies to things like:

• Pricing terms

discount rate (e.g., 20% → 25%)

valuation cap (e.g., $10M → $8M)

• Rights & protections

information rights

pro-rata rights

liquidation preferences

anti-dilution adjustments

• Warrant coverage

e.g., if someone gets warrants and you didn’t

• Side letters

special rights not in the main docs

With MFN, the earlier investor upgrades automatically without renegotiating.

🔍 Why founders give MFN

Usually because:

✔ early money is higher risk
✔ founders don’t want to set valuation too early
✔ avoids promising specific terms now
✔ lets future rounds “price” the instrument

Common scenario:
Early investors put in a SAFE with MFN → seed round later sets discount/cap → MFN investors inherit those terms.

⚠️ What MFN does not usually cover

It typically does not force the company to match:

✖ equity price from a priced round
✖ full investor rights packages (e.g., board seats)
✖ large investor custom provisions

Often the MFN is scoped (“similar instruments” only).

🏦 Example (SAFE Cohort)

Angel A invests $100k SAFE, no cap, no discount, with MFN

6 months later Seed investor B invests SAFE w/ $10M cap + 20% discount
→ Angel A inherits $10M cap + 20% discount automatically

This is extremely common in US YC-style SAFEs and increasingly in AU early rounds.

🇦🇺 Australian context (good to know)

In Australia MFN shows up in:

✔ SAFE clones (AirTree, Blackbird, US YC docs)
✔ Convertible notes
✔ Founders raising through ESS/ownership structures
✔ Angel syndicates

Less common in:
✖ priced rounds (Series A+)
✖ ESOP/ESS employee options

Because employees don’t negotiate securities the same way investors do.

🎯 Why investors ask for MFN

They want protection against:

valuation uncertainty

asymmetric bargaining power later

getting “burned” for coming in early

It also keeps them “mentally safe” accepting weaker initial terms.

🧩 Why founders sometimes resist MFN

MFN can restrict flexibility later:

Seed investors may demand unique terms

Large institutional investors dislike handcuffs

Legal work becomes messier if MFN applies broadly

Often founders narrow MFN to:

▶ “same class of security”
▶ “unpriced instruments only”
▶ “during note period only”

📝 Short definition (plain language)

MFN = early investors get upgraded if future investors get a better deal.

If you want — I can also explain MFN in relation to:

✔ SAFEs vs Convertible Notes
✔ ESS/ESOP (AU context)
✔ How cap table tools model MFN
✔ How reverse vesting interacts (it doesn’t usually)
✔ MFN variants (broad vs narrow vs conditional)

Just tell me which angle you care about.

What is the process on constructing a fundraising round contract called?

There are a few terms people use depending on stage, country, and instrument, but the generic/umbrella answer is:

Term Sheet → Due Diligence → Definitive Agreements → Closing

And that whole process is often called:

“Papering the Round” (US/VC slang)
or
“Documentation” / “Documenting the Round” (formal)

More formal legal phrasing

Lawyers will say the company is:

“Documenting a financing round”
or
“Preparing definitive agreements for the financing”

This covers:

subscription agreements

shareholders deeds

convertible note/SAFE instruments

board resolutions

disclosures

cap table updates

closing mechanics

Venture capital phrasing

VCs and founders often call it:

“Papering the term sheet”
or
“Papering the deal”

Meaning turning the agreed business terms into legally enforceable contracts.

Corporate law phrasing (AU / UK context)

In Australia, lawyers often refer to it as:

“Running the transaction documents”
or
“Settling the transaction documents”

For priced rounds:

Subscription Agreement + Shareholders Agreement

For seed SAFEs/notes:

Convertible/SAFE documentation

Practical startup phrasing

Founders will just say:

✔ “We’re closing the round”
✔ “We’re documenting the round”
✔ “We’re papering the terms”

If what you meant was the legal craft itself

That’s transactional law or venture financing law.

If you meant the process management:
That’s deal execution.

If you meant the economic modeling:
That’s round structuring or cap table modeling.

If you meant the negotiation phase:
That’s term sheet negotiation.

Bonus — where MFN fits

MFN clauses (your prior question) sit in the definitive agreements stage, usually inside:

SAFE

Convertible note

Side letter

Term sheet (occasionally)

Quick summary answer

The process of constructing the fundraising round contract is typically called:

Papering the Round or Documenting the Round

If you want, I can also outline:

✔ roles involved (founder, lead investor, counsel, accountants)
✔ AU-specific document stack vs US
✔ timeline to close
✔ who drives what
✔ how this appears in a cap table app (since you’re building one)

What is a warrant in this context?

In startup/VC financing, a warrant is a contract that gives an investor the right (but not obligation) to buy shares later at a fixed price — usually for some number of years.

Think of it as a cousin to options, but issued to investors rather than employees.

🧾 What a warrant actually grants

The holder can buy X shares at Y price until Z date.

Example:

Buy 100,000 shares

At $1.00 per share (exercise price)

Any time in the next 5 years

If the company’s value goes up and shares are worth $5:
→ Investor can exercise at $1 and capture the upside.

If value never goes up:
→ Investor does nothing; warrant expires worthless.

🧩 Why warrants show up in fundraising

Warrants often appear as sweeteners or compensation mechanics in:

✔ Bridge rounds
✔ Convertible notes
✔ Venture debt
✔ Strategic partnerships
✔ Syndicates & accelerators
✔ Hard-to-price rounds
✔ High-risk early checks

They’re used to boost investor upside without changing valuation.

💰 How warrants relate to valuation

Important distinction:

Valuation affects share price

Warrant gives you a fixed price

So warrants can preserve economics when valuation is fuzzy or contentious.

🏦 Example (Convertible Note + Warrants)

Investor puts in $1M on a note
Note converts at 20% discount
PLUS receives a 10% warrant coverage

“10% warrant coverage” means if the company raises $10M next round:
→ Investor gets $1M worth of warrants at the priced share.

🧮 Warrants & Cap Table Impact

Warrants sit in the fully diluted layer alongside:

ESOP/ESS options

SAFEs

Convertible notes

RSUs

Other warrants

For modeling purposes, warrants usually show up as:

number of shares + exercise price + expiry

Cap table tooling (like what you’re building) must include them in fd post-money dilution scenarios.

🆚 Warrant vs. Option (short clarity)
Feature Warrant Option
Typical holder Investors Employees
Purpose Sweetener/compensation Compensation & retention
Shelf life Longer (5–10 yrs) Shorter (3–4 yrs)
Negotiated? Yes Rarely
Legal form Contract/Instrument Equity Plan Option Grant
Gov frameworks Securities law ESOP/ESS plans
🌏 Australian context (bonus for you)

In AU you see warrants more in:

Convertible notes

Venture debt

Strategic corporate deals

PE/VC hybrids

Less common in:

pure angel/seed

traditional priced venture rounds

ESS/ESOP contexts

Also note: ASIC-approved ESS frameworks don’t govern warrants.

🎯 Why warrants matter to MFN (previous topic)

If future investors receive warrants on better terms (exercise price, coverage, duration), MFN may upgrade an earlier investor’s warrant package — hence why they need to be modeled as independent instruments
